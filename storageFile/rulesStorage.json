        "5": "No loli or foalcon. We go by appearance for this rule and not canonical age. If it's a fictional character and can pass for 18, then it's allowed. The same goes in reverse though. If a character is older than 18, but looks like a loli, it's not kosher here.",

This server is primarily for the sharing and distribution of drawn art (traditional, digital, 3D-modeling, etc.) both safe and explicit. For clarification, the 'art-sharing-nsfw' channel is the channel that usually has the month in the title. As an example, it is currently 'always-anal-april-nsfw' as of the writing of this rule.",
